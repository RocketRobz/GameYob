GameYob-Accurate is a project to increase the accuracy of GameYob in pursuit of a BGB/SameBoy-level NDS/3DS GBx emulator with no regard to emulation speed. 

As of now, GameYob-Accurate passes the following blargg accuracy tests:

cpu_instrs: All
cgb_sound: 01, 08, 10
oam_bug: 03, 06
dmg_sound: 01
halt_bug: None
instr_timing: None
interrupt_time: None
mem_timing: None
mem_timing_2: None

I am not maintaining the SDL version but, due to how GameYob was initially set up, the SDL version will receive most of the core updates. My focus is on the DS family's ports.
